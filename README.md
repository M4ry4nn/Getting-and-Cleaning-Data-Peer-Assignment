# Getting and Cleaning Data, Peer Assignment

## Purpose
The purpose of the R Script run_analysis.R is to create a tidy data set for further analytics. The data source is
the UCI Machine Learning Repository website. It provides data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

<u>Following operations will be performed by running run_analysis.R</u>

* 1. Downloads and unzippes the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip into your current working directory.
* 2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* 5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* 6. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
