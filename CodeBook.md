Information about the original data can be found here:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.
- A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A

### Explore the data
To prepare a tidy data set the first step is to explore the given data. For machine learning purpose the data is divided into 
two groups "x_train.txt" and "x_test.txt". The activities of this groups are recorded in the y_test.txt and y_train.txt with the numbers 1 to 6. 
The assigned activity name to each number can be found in the "activity_labels.txt".
The featurenames of the data is provided in: "features.txt" 

### Combine the data to one tidy data set

In the first step I merged all train and test data sets by rows and labled the data set with descriptive variable names. 
Than I merged the subject Numbers 'subjectNO', the y_all activity numberbs 'activityNO', the activity 'activity' and the 'x_all' data set by column.
The resulting data frame is called 'entire_data'
The 'entire_data' is reduced to a frame only containing the measurements mean and standard deviation 'extracted_data'.
The data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject is called 'secondframe'.


### Resulting datasets
The results of the last two steps are written into two data frames: "tidy_data.txt" and "second_tidy_data.txt".
